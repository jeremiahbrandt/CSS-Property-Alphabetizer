# CSS Property Alphabetizer

## Purpose
This script creates new a CSS file with alphabetically sorted properties. 
It does not sort selectors.
It works well with my personal styling preferences and is not bug-proof, use at your own risk.

## Usage
    py CSSPropertyAlphabetizer.py FILE.css
Will create alphabetized-FILE.css
